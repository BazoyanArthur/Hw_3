[CS 230] Homework 3

Here you can find 2 classes. Traveler and GateKeeper.

The job of the GateKeeper is to not let any travelers pass through a gate without paying. The GateKeeper has a mood which can be good or bad.
In case of a good mood, the GateKeeper gives the traveler a discount. 
Also depending on the time of the day the price for passing varies. 
If the traveler fails to pay, the Gatekeeper will kill the traveler. 

The travelers job is just to pass through the gate. If he has enough money to meet the gateKeepers demands, he passes through the gate, if not, he will attempt to run away from the
gateKeeper. He will always fail to run away and will die.
